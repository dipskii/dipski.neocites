      <h1>perry caravello</h1>
        <p class="mla">Perry Frank Caravello, born November 17th, 1963, is an American actor, comedian, and lolcow who is best known as the star of the 2003 movie Windy City Heat and the host of the internet stream Perry Caravello Live. Caravello was born in Park Ridge, Illinois and later moved to Reseda, California with his family at the age of 11 years old in 1974 (Kill Tony). In 1979, three weeks after getting his driver’s license, he was injured in a car accident that put him in a coma for three weeks (Hyden). As a result of the accident, Caravello suffered brain trauma (#096: Morning Session).</p>
        <p class="mla">Caravello started his career in acting and standup comedy around 1988, and early in his career was trying to get into The Comedy Store, an American comedy club in West Hollywood, California, when, then host, Don Barris challenged him to have his chest shaved onstage with a razor and no soap. Caravello did the stunt and was given a regular spot at the comedy club (Hyden). As a result, frequent comedic collaborations between Caravello and Barris, along with Tony Barbieri (aka “Mole”) ensued. All of which were typically at the expense of Caravello (Windy City Heat - Classic Big Three Moments (1992 - 2002)). In 1992, Caravello was working on a Christina Applegate movie. After the day wrapped, he flagged down a woman who worked on the movie on the highway, went up to her car window and propositioned her. This freaked out the woman so badly that she reported this to Randy Callahan who was a casting director or agent. Randy summoned Perry to his office and gave him the ultimatum to either leave or suck his dick. Perry didn’t want to, but agreed to jerk off Randy while Randy sucked him off (Gay Bullied, 42:40). In 1994, Perry became addicted to crack, Don and Mole were able to get him clean.</p>
        <p class="mla">In 2003, Caravello starred in the Comedy Central reality movie Windy City Heat, directed by Bobcat Goldthwait and written by Barris and Barbieri, and produced by Jimmy Kimmel’s Jackhole Productions. All three co-starrred in the movie (Hyden). The movie was one elaborate prank on Perry, who was under the impression he had landed his first starring role in a major motion picture. The movie followed him from the beginning, being cast in the picture to the conclusion of the “one-night only” premiere where he was awarded a trophy for his “outstanding work”. Caravello later had roles in Hot Package, Derek and Simon, and Virtuosity and was also an extra in Austin Powers in Goldmember where he can be seen multiple times during the prison rap scene (Perry F. Caravello - IMDb).</p>
        <p class="mla">After Windy City Heat, Caravello started working with Richard Heene on a project called Psyience Detectives in which they played storm chasing detectives. This project ended during production in 2006 when the two men got involved in a physical altercation while filming (Miller). After the Balloon boy hoax perpetrated by Heene, Caravello made frequent TV appearances in which he was interviewed in regard to Heene’s character. He was then invited on Jimmy Kimmel Live! where he was lampooned for taking advantage of his “15 minutes of fame” in light of the incident.</p>
        <p class="mla">On June 1st, 2007, Caravello filed a lawsuit alleging that Jimmy Kimmel, Adam Carolla, and Johnny Knoxville promised him ten million dollars if he put his penis in a mousetrap during an episode of The Adam Carolla Show. The lawsuit was filed after Caravello was injured in the stunt, was not paid, and did not receive accounting of profits and royalties from DVD sales of Windy City Heat (Jackass star is sued over stunt) (Associated Press).</p>
        <p class="mla">Perry used to work at his cousin’s print shop until around 2010 when the shop went out of business. Later in 2010, Caravello, Barris, and Barbieri started a weekly comedy podcast called The Big 3 Podcast, named by Jimmy Kimmel, on ACE Broadcasting Network (The Big 3 Podcast Premiere). In 2011, the show moved to Barris’ own network (The Big Goodbye), before ending in April 2015 (For Real ... The Final Podcast). Caravello has spoken on Simply Don The Podcast from 2014 through 2020 (Perry F. Caravello). In November 2020, Caravello launched his own livestream on Twitch (and later expanded to YouTube) with the help of his publicist Tom Brennan. The following Perry obtained from Windy City Heat proved to make his streaming channels successful and began streaming 3 to 4 days a week (About Perry_Caravello_Live - Twitch) (Perry Caravello - YouTube).</p>
        <p class="mla">In a May 2019 episode of Simply Don The Podcast, Caravello revealed that he would be running for President of the United States in the 2020 U.S. presidential election (Barris, 213th Podcast). Caravello has stated that he would run as an independent on a platform that included abolishing money, building a wall across the Canada-United States border, providing free universal healthcare, legalizing medical marijuana, abolishing gay marriage, and criminalizing homosexuality (Barris, 214th Podcast). He stays he would like to turn San Clemente Island into a gay prison. He announced he had abandoned his run (which he claimed was a joke) on July 18th, 2020 (Caravello).</p>
        <p class="mla">On April 23rd, 2015, a thread was posted by user BrunoMattei on Kiwi Farms titled “Perry Caravello + Big 3 Community + Tom Brennan / Tom B.”, subtitled “Fat, homophobic, greasy, boomer streamer, star of Windy City Heat and Simon S. Salty. Party at 7722 reseda blvd apt 102”. The thread details numerous instances of trolling directed towards Perry. The post reads:
        <p class="mla-quote">Here’s my breakdown: Perry Caravello (frequently misspelled as Caramello or Karavello) is a guy who moved to Hollywood in the early 90’s trying to be a star. Problem is that he’s not funny, he can’t act, and he could be legit retarded in addition to being an asshole. Perry was “discovered” at the Comedy Store by Don Barris. Don Barris has been long time friends with Jimmy Kimmel and has done a lot at the Comedy Store and currently is the audience warm up for Jimmy Kimmel Live. Don saw potential in Perry and introduced him to Walter Molinski (or Tony Barbieri, another long-time friend of Jimmy Kimmel and a current writer on Jimmy Kimmel Live). They’ve been fucking with Perry ever since. Culminating in a prank film called Windy City Heat and here’s a clip from that: (BrunoMattei).</p>
